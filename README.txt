# Tydra Sanitation — v4.3
Changes:
- **Rotating testimonials carousel** with dots, autoplay, and pause on hover.
- **Google Review button** now points to a default Google search for your reviews. Replace with your GBP review link when you have it.
- All v4.2 features kept: suburb pages (incl. Universal City), thank-you page + Plausible events, Sheets logging, QR, gallery, etc.

## Swap in your actual Google review URL
Open `index.html` and replace the value of `DEFAULT_REVIEW_URL` near the top of the file with your real link (from Google Business Profile → Ask for reviews → Copy link).

## Deploy
GitHub → Vercel (Framework: None/Other; Build: empty; Output: `/`).
